Steps of building a tree
*****************************

Make multiple sequence alignment for Globin gene family
----------------------------------------------------------
:Step 1: Download globin.fasta from Blackboard and perform a MSA using MUSCLE (follow the steps we discussed last week).

:Step 2: Examine the alignment to make sure it is correct and no additional editing is needed. 

:Step 2: Export the alignment as a fasta format file on your Desktop. Name it as globin_align


Find informative sites for Parsimony 
----------------------------------------

:Step 1: Open the alignment file you just created by going to using **Open file/Session** under **Data**

:Step 2: Go to **Explore Active Data** under **Data**


:Step 3: Click on **Pi** button and this show site that are informative for Parsimony

Building Phylogenetic trees
----------------------------------------

:Step 1: Click on **Phylogeny**

:Step 2: Make Neighbor-Joining tree with **Bootstrap 500 replicates**

	:A: What relationships can you see in the tree?

	:B: What can you say about the statistical support for each relationship?

	:C: What should be the out-group?

:Step 3: Save the tree as a pdf file by clicking on **Image** button


:Step 4: Build a tree using Parsimony method with **50 Bootstrap** replicates (500 will be very slow).

	:A: What relationships can you see in the tree?

	:B: What can you say about the statistical support for each relationship?

	:C: Do you see the same relationships that you saw with NJ tree?
